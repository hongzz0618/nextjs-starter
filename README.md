## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. It is developed and maintained by Vercel.

## Benefits of Next.js

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can generate static pages at build time, which can be served quickly to users.
- **API Routes**: Next.js provides a way to create API endpoints within your application, making it easy to handle backend logic.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits your code, optimizing the loading time of your application.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: You can import CSS and Sass files directly into your components.
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js includes an image component that automatically optimizes images.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: You can update static content after the build without rebuilding the entire site.

## Problems Solved by Next.js

- **SEO**: Server-side rendering improves SEO by providing fully rendered HTML to search engines.
